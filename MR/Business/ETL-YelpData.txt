1. design MR alforithm to load each Yelp business file into Hadoop
2. test it in local Hadoop VM
3. test it in hadoop cluster


Data format:

  'business_id': (encrypted business id),
  'name': (business name),
  'neighborhoods': [(hood names)],

  'votes': {'useful': (count), 'funny': (count), 'cool': (count)}
}

  'type': 'user',
  'user_id': (encrypted user id),
  'name': (first name),

If there are no checkins for a business, the entire record will be omitted.

{
  'type': 'checkin',
  'business_id': (encrypted business id),
  'checkin_info': {
        '0-0': (number of checkins from 00:00 to 01:00 on all Sundays),
        '1-0': (number of checkins from 01:00 to 02:00 on all Sundays), 
        ...

        ...
        '23-6': (number of checkins from 23:00 to 00:00 on all Saturdays)

}
